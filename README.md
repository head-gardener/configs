### Configs
Various config files, collected in one place for my convenience.

### Management
See `./manage help` for usage.

### Directory structure
- `home` goes to `$HOME`
- `config` to `$HOME/.config/`

### Cool features I remember
- /opt/orph is on PATH. Put orphaned symlinks there.
- **soystemctl**
- `--color=auto`
